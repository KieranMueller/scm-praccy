<div class="container">
  <div class="content">
    <h1 class="title">Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Not sure what we should now...</p>

      Want to make a sweet top bar that spans the width of the page and has a
      few buttons? <br />We can add some components after that, and have the
      buttons direct to those pages
